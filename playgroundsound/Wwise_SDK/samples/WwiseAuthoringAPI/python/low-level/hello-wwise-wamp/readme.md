# Hello Wwise Wamp - Python Sample
## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Wwise through WAAPI using Python with Autobahn and Asyncio.

## Requirements

Make sure you have pip installed (it should be provided with the Python installation and the command might not be available until you restart your computer).

Install Autobahn using the following command in the terminal:

Windows:
``` py -3 -m pip install autobahn ```

macOS, Linux
``` python3 -m pip install autobahn ```

## Execution

Run the following commands from the "hello-wwise-wamp" directory:

Windows:
``` py -3 main_py3.py ```

macOS, Linux:
``` python3 main_py3 ```

If the Wwise Authoring API successfully connects to Wwise, you should see the following output:

``` Hello Wwise 20??.?.? ```

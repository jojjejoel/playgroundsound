**PLAYGROUNDSOUND**

This project showcases different audio features that utilizes Wwise's C++ SDK, such as obstruction/occlusion and RTPCs.

To build the solution, open and build it with Visual Studio. It has only been tested and verified to work on 64-bit Windows operating systems.

Controls for the game:
- UP/DOWN to gas/break with the car.
- LEFT/RIGHT to steer.
- Press 1 to toggle opening/closing the door (Wwise portal) that hides the music emitter.
- Press 2/3 to decrease/increase the playback speed of the music.

The music played in the game is made by me and I own all the rights for it.

Rendering and input handling is done with **raylib**. I take no credit for any of the code located in the **raylib-master** folder. Check out https://www.raylib.com/ for more info.
